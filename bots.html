  <h2 class="center">Python RPG Game</h2>
  <h3 class="center">
    <img src="images/pokemon1.png" alt="Me"/><br>
This week, we used Python to make a minimalistic turn-based RPG,
where you battle our Mentors In Training. I am working on taking the framework from
this game and turning it into a full pokemon engine. <br> Progress so far has been slow, but I have all of next week to
improve it. Instead of you and the enemy MIT's stats being pre-set and static, both the player and enemy pokemon
are chosen from an array, with individual stats for health, attack, defence, special attack, special defence, and speed.
Speed and the special stats aren't used yet, but that shouldn't be too complicated. Attack and defence are used in
a equation based on the actual Pokemon games to calculate damage done.<br>  Expect support for multiple moves, items,
and using a team of pokemon! <br>

...also you can't lose yet. That should be fixed soon.

  <h2 class="center">HTML + CSS + Javascript</h2>
  <h3 class="center">
My other project this week is the website you're looking at now! This is bar none the most complex website I've made yet.
The title at the top of the page was made completely with Javascript and a truckload of CSS. It generates one of almost 20
titles for the page, with matching, hot pink splash text. <br><a href="bots.html">Check it out!</a><br> That effect was
acheived via Javascript, which I discovered was... pretty annoying. Also annoying were the cool image at the bottom of the
  screen. they're actually two different images placed on top of one another. HTML doesn't like that.<br> But hey, it works!
  <br> ...as long as you don't use Internet Explorer.<br>  Or Microsoft Edge.<br>  Or smartphones.<br>  Or different screen sizes. <br>
