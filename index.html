Hey, what's good? I'm Will, I'm 14 and and this is my fourth year at CompCamps.
I've actually lived in Ontario for the past few years,
and I've been fortunate enough to be able to fly back for the past two camps.
It's killer. This year, we've been learning about cryptocurrency. <br>
<img  style="  height: 400px;   width: 400px;" src="images/me.png" alt="Me"/><br>
Everyone was given a miner for a mentor-developed CompCoin, a simplified cryptocurrency.<br>
...it was chaos.<br>
There were robberies, the cookies I brought for the campers were auctioned (!!!), and the miner was hacked. a lot.
I ended up pooling all of my coins with Eli and AJ, which is why i don't have any in my account. Totally. No really I swear.
I had actually discovered that you could transfer someone a negative amount of coins to easily steal from them... a day after everone else had.
So, I had a glorious 15 minuites with about 100 quadrillion CompCoins. and then it was fixed. Oh well. At least I was able to buy back some of my cookies.
